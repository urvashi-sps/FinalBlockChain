                        This is a marketplace that runs on the blockchain, kind of like Craigslist. It allows people to list items for sale, but unlike Craigslist, it also allows people to purchase them on the website with cryptocurrency.

                        <p className='text-left text-white font-light md:w-9/12 w-11/12 text-base'>Whenever someone purchases the item, they instantly become the owner. Thatâ€™s because this application is powered by a smart contract on the blockchain which manages the market place. It tracks who owns the items for sale, and it transfers the ownership of the items automatically anytime someone purchases them with cryptocurrency. It works like a vending machine.</p>
